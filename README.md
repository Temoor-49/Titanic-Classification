## 🔧 Feature Engineering

Our preprocessing pipeline creates several new features to improve model performance:

### Created Features:

1. **Title Extraction**: Extracted from passenger names
   - Categories: Mr, Mrs, Miss, Master, Rare
   - Captures social status and gender information

2. **FamilySize**: Total family members aboard
   - Formula: `SibSp + Parch + 1`
   - Helps identify solo travelers vs families

3. **AgeBin**: Age groups for better pattern recognition
   - Bins: 0-12, 12-18, 18-35, 35-50, 50-80

4. **FareBin**: Fare quartiles
   - 4 equal-sized bins based on fare distribution

### Handling Missing Values:
- **Age**: Filled with median (29.7 years)
- **Fare**: Filled with median (32.2)
- **Embarked**: Filled with mode ('S' - Southampton)
- **Cabin**: Dropped (77% missing)

### Encoding:
- **Sex**: Binary encoding (male=0, female=1)
- **Embarked**: Label encoding (C=0, Q=1, S=2)
- **Title**: Label encoding with consistent mapping

## 🎯 Making Predictions

### Option 1: Generate Kaggle Submission

```bash
cd src
python evaluate.py
```

This creates `submission.csv` for Kaggle submission.

### Option 2: Predict Custom Passengers

```python
from src.predict import predict_new_passengers
import pandas as pd

# Create passenger data
new_passenger = pd.DataFrame([{
    "PassengerId": 1001,
    "Pclass": 1,
    "Name": "Brown, Mrs. Alice",
    "Sex": "female",
    "Age": 25,
    "SibSp": 0,
    "Parch": 0,
    "Ticket": "PC 17599",
    "Fare": 71.28,
    "Cabin": "C85",
    "Embarked": "C"
}])

# Get predictions
predictions = predict_new_passengers(new_passenger, model_name='gradient_boosting')
print(f"Prediction: {'Survived' if predictions[0] == 1 else 'Did not survive'}")
```

**Output:**
```
Preprocessing 1 passenger(s)...
Loading model: gradient_boosting...
Making predictions...
Brown, Mrs. Alice              | Survived ✅
```

## 🔬 Model Performance Details

### Confusion Matrix Interpretation:

```
                Predicted
                No    Yes
Actual  No     [92]   [13]   ← 92 correctly predicted deaths
        Yes    [16]   [58]   ← 58 correctly predicted survivals
```

- **True Positives (58)**: Correctly predicted survivors
- **True Negatives (92)**: Correctly predicted non-survivors
- **False Positives (13)**: Incorrectly predicted as survivors
- **False Negatives (16)**: Incorrectly predicted as non-survivors

### Feature Importance (from Random Forest):

1. **Title** (0.25): Strongest predictor
2. **Fare** (0.22): Second most important
3. **Age** (0.18): Third most important
4. **Pclass** (0.15): Class matters
5. **Sex** (0.12): Gender is significant
6. **FamilySize** (0.05): Smaller effect
7. **Embarked** (0.03): Minimal impact
